To run:

* In `EventGenerator/EventGenerator`: `dotnet run EventGenerator.csproj`
* In `EventListener/EventListener`: In an admin console: `dotnet run EventListener.csproj`
* In `viewer`:
    * `npm install` (install node.js if npm does not exist)
    * Open `index.html` in a browser

Note, it should work regardless of the order these three programs are started in, and it should be fine to restart any one without restarting the others.
